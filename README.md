# Face-Recogination-system

This project demonstrates a machine learning approach to facial recognition by leveraging the Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) dataset. The goal is to train a model capable of identifying individuals based on their facial features. 
It combines:

- Principal Component Analysis (PCA): For feature extraction and dimensionality reduction.
- Support Vector Machines (SVM): For accurate classification.
- Scikit-learn Pipelines: To ensure modular and maintainable implementation.

## Features
- Dimensionality Reduction: PCA is applied to extract the most important features from high-dimensional face data.

- Classification: SVC is trained on the PCA-transformed features to distinguish between different faces.

- Pipeline Implementation: The entire workflow (preprocessing, PCA, SVC) is encapsulated in a Scikit-learn pipeline.

- Modular and Extensible: The project can be easily extended with additional preprocessing steps or alternative classifiers.
  
- ## Dataset
The project utilizes the Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) dataset, a publicly available collection of face images created to facilitate research in unconstrained face recognition.
## Libraries Used
- Scikit-learn (sklearn): Used for implementing machine learning techniques like PCA, SVM, and pipelines to build the facial recognition system.
- Matplotlib: Utilized to visualize data, including sample images and evaluation metrics.
- Seaborn: Used for creating detailed and visually appealing plots, such as confusion matrices, to analyze model performance.
- Pandas: Used for efficient data manipulation and analysis of the dataset.
- NumPy: Provides support for numerical operations, including handling arrays and matrices for feature extraction and model training.
